## 🫧About Me

I have combined self-taught technical skills with emotional awareness to create real impact.
I am not someone who just writes or codes. I connect what I learn in books to the real world.

Like water that takes the shape of its container, I shape myself around every opportunity I receive
and strive to adapt and grow within it.
